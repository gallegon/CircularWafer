# CircularWafer
Uses winforms in visual studio 2022.  To use this program enter the number of points you wish to generate on the wafer's surface in the text box (as an integer) and click the "Draw Points" button to draw the wafer and points to the screen.  There is no input validation so invalid inputs may cause the program to crash.
